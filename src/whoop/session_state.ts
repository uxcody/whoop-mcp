// Per-process "catalog consulted" gate. (One Set per server process. In stdio
// mode that's one client; in HTTP multi-session mode it's shared across
// sessions — harmless for this single-user MCP, but not literally per-session.)
//
// MCP servers run as a persistent process per client. Tools that take large-
// enum-style IDs (sport_id, exercise_id, behavior_tracker_id) refuse to run
// until the AI has called the corresponding lookup tool at least once in the
// session. This lets us keep example IDs out of every tool's description (saves
// ~3-5k system-prompt tokens per session) while still enforcing that the AI
// has actually seen the real catalog before guessing.
//
// Catalog → unlock tool → gated tools:
//   sports    ← whoop_sports_catalog  → whoop_activity_create
//   exercises ← whoop_lift_catalog    → whoop_lift_log, whoop_lift_exercise,
//                                       whoop_lift_progression, whoop_lift_template_save,
//                                       whoop_lift_custom_exercise
//   behaviors ← whoop_journal_catalog → whoop_journal_log, whoop_symptom_log
