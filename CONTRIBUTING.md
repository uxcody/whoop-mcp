# Contributing to whoop-mcp

Pull requests welcome. The codebase is small and the test suite is fast, so iteration is quick.

```

Every tool follows a three-layer pattern: **schema** (defines the output shape) → **projection** (walks the raw API response into that shape) → **tool** (registers it with the MCP server, validates input args, calls the client, runs the projection, returns).

See [README.md → Architecture](README.md#architecture) for the full pattern walkthrough. See [README.md → Remote hosting](README.md#remote-hosting) for the HTTP transport architecture (added in v1.1.0).

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/briangaoo/whoop-mcp.git
cd whoop-mcp
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env with your Whoop creds
npm run cognito-bootstrap
npm test           # 127 tests, <1s
npm run typecheck
npm run build

# stdio mode (default, for local Claude Desktop / Claude Code):
npm run dev

# HTTP mode (for remote hosting via Docker/Fly/etc.):
MCP_AUTH_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 32) npm run dev:http
curl http://localhost:3000/health   # → {"status":"ok"}
```

## Adding a new tool

Walkthrough lives in [README.md → Adding a new tool](README.md#adding-a-new-tool). Short version:

1. Pick a source endpoint (browse [`WHOOP_API_ENDPOINTS.md`](WHOOP_API_ENDPOINTS.md) for the relevant microservice).
2. Add a zod schema in `src/schemas/`.
3. Add a projection function in `src/projections/`. Tested against captured fixtures in `tests/fixtures/*.json`.
4. Add a tool file in `src/tools/v2/` (~30 lines: register with the MCP server, parse args, call client, project, validate, return).
5. Wire it up in `src/tools/register.ts`.
6. Add a projection test in `tests/projections/`.
7. `npm run typecheck && npm test && npm run build`.

## Fixing a broken projection (Whoop API drift)

When Whoop changes a response shape, projections may start returning all-null or partial outputs. They typically don't throw — zod schemas validate the *shape*, not the *content*, so null-heavy outputs pass validation silently.

To debug:

1. Hit the endpoint live via `whoop_raw` — get the current shape into your hands.
2. Save it as a captured fixture under `tests/fixtures/`.
3. Diff against the old fixture. Common drift patterns:
   - Tile types renamed (e.g. `GRAPHING_CARD` → `SCORE_GAUGE`)
   - Card titles changed (e.g. `"RECOVERY"` → no title, identified by `content.id` instead)
   - Sport name mappings changed (e.g. `weightlifting_msk` exposed via different internal_name)
4. Rewrite the projection to walk the new shape.
5. Update the per-projection tests with the new expected values.
6. Document the migration in [`WHOOP_API_ENDPOINTS.md`](WHOOP_API_ENDPOINTS.md) so the next person knows.

Recent precedents to read:
- May 2026 deep-dive migration: `src/projections/recovery.ts`, `src/projections/strain.ts`. See [Pattern 2b in the endpoints doc](WHOOP_API_ENDPOINTS.md).
- Sport-name filter fix: `src/projections/lift_history.ts` — old `/strength/i` regex matched none of `weightlifting_msk` / `weightlifting` / `powerlifting`.

---

## Testing

- **`npm test`** — 127 unit tests in <1s. Fixture-driven for projections; integration-style for the HTTP transport (`tests/whoop/http_auth.test.ts` spins up a real `http.Server` and hits it with `fetch`).
- **Live-API tests live in a separate `whoop-testing` archive.** They require a dummy account and aren't safe to expose to first-time users. If you want to add or run them, ask Brian.
- When fixing a projection, update its fixture in `tests/fixtures/` and the corresponding test in `tests/projections/round{1,2,3}.test.ts`.
- When changing the HTTP transport (`src/server-http.ts`) or auth model, add coverage to `tests/whoop/http_auth.test.ts`. The pattern is: boot a real server on an ephemeral port with a stub `WhoopClient`, then assert with `fetch()`.

---

## Code style

- TypeScript 6 strict mode (`noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, `noImplicitOverride`).
- No `any`. Use `unknown` + narrow with `isObject` / `asString` / `asNumber` from `src/lib/walk.ts`.
- Match the existing conventions in adjacent files — don't unilaterally refactor.
- Don't add features beyond what the task requires.
- One tool per file. ~30 lines is normal; over 100 is a smell unless the schema is genuinely complex (`whoop_smart_alarm_set` has 4 modes — that's fine).

---

## Commit style

Follow what's already in the log:

```
fix: whoop_recovery + whoop_strain were silently returning all-null

<one paragraph explaining what broke and how you found it>
<one paragraph on the fix>
<verification: live-API check or test result>
```

For commits that change behavior, include a before/after measurement when possible. The bug reports + fixes in the existing log are good models.

---

## Reporting bugs

Open an issue with:
- Which tool
- The exact arguments you called it with
- The full output (especially if it's all-null or partial)
- The current state of your account that should be in the output (e.g. "I have 3 workouts on May 23 but `whoop_workouts` returns empty")

If you can attach a `whoop_raw` capture of the underlying endpoint, even better.

## Code of conduct

Be decent. This is a small project run by a teenager.
