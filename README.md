## Quickstart (5 minutes)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/briangaoo/whoop-mcp.git
cd whoop-mcp && npm install && npm run build && npm link
```

Then **one guided command** does everything — auth, setup, and connecting to Claude:

```bash
# ★ Recommended — deploy to a host + connect Claude on web, desktop, AND mobile:
whoop-mcp cloud

# Or run it locally on this machine (stdio, this device only):
whoop-mcp local
```

**`whoop-mcp cloud`** walks you through: Whoop login (SMS handled) → pick a host (Fly / Railway / Koyeb / Cloud Run / your own server) → it generates secrets, sets env, deploys, verifies the server + OAuth are live, then hands you the URL + password to paste into Claude's connector settings. By the end, Claude is connected across every device on your account.

**`whoop-mcp local`** walks you through: Whoop login → build → writing the Claude Desktop config (or the Claude Code one-liner). Restart Claude and you're done.

When the 30-day token expires, run **`whoop-mcp refresh`** (silent if your account has no SMS MFA; prompts for the code if it does).

Then ask Claude: *"how am I doing today on whoop?"*

> Prefer to wire it up by hand? The guided commands just automate the steps in [The `whoop-mcp` CLI](#the-whoop-mcp-cli), [Remote hosting](#remote-hosting), and [Configuration](#configuration). Stuck? [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

## Why this exists

Whoop ships two APIs:

- The **public developer API** at [`developer.whoop.com`](https://developer.whoop.com/api/) is OAuth2, read-only, and exposes **13 endpoints** under 6 scopes. You get recovery score, sleep stage totals, workout strain, body measurements (3 fields), and HRV/RHR per cycle. No journal, no Strength Trainer, no Whoop Coach, no hypnogram, no stress monitor, no trends, no writes, nothing else. Numeric `sport_id` was removed 2025-09-01.
- The **private iOS API** is what the actual Whoop app uses — `api.prod.whoop.com` behind AWS Cognito. **384 distinct operations across 47 microservices**, including everything missing from above.

This MCP wraps the iOS surface.

### What the iOS API has that the public OAuth doesn't

| Capability | Tool |
|---|---|
| HRV / RHR / respiratory / VO2 / weight time-series (25 metrics × up to 4 windows) | `whoop_trend` |
| Hypnogram (per-minute sleep stage timeline) | `whoop_sleep` |
| Strength Trainer — every set, every workout, full 372-exercise catalog, PRs | `whoop_lift_*` (8 tools) |
| 308-behavior Journal + behavior impact analysis | `whoop_journal*` (5 tools) |
| Stress monitor (15-min buckets) | `whoop_stress, whoop_live_stress` |
| Whoop Coach AI chat | `whoop_coach_ask` |
| Smart Alarm (read + 4 write modes) | `whoop_smart_alarm*` |
| HR zones (read + configure max HR / 5 custom zones) | `whoop_hr_zones*` |
| Compare-windows, sleep coach, calendar grid, performance assessment | `whoop_compare`, `whoop_sleep_need`, `whoop_calendar`, `whoop_performance_assessment` |
| Live HR / activity state / live stress | `whoop_live_*` (3 tools) |
| Community leaderboards, hidden metrics, women's health (cycle / symptoms / MCI) | `whoop_leaderboard`, `whoop_hidden_metric`, `whoop_cycle*` |
| **14 write tools** — log workouts, journal entries, profile edits, smart-alarm config | various |

If recovery + sleep totals + workout list is enough for you, use the public OAuth API. If anything in the table is interesting, you need this. The iOS API was discovered via mitmproxy — full methodology in [`WHOOP.md`](WHOOP.md).

## What it does

The MCP runs as a local Node process. It speaks **Model Context Protocol** over stdio (or HTTP for remote deployments), registers 48 tools at startup, and waits for tool calls from a connected MCP client.

When a tool is called:

1. Authenticates via the cached Cognito access token (auto-refreshes if expired)
2. Issues HTTP requests to `api.prod.whoop.com`
3. Walks the response to extract a flat domain object (the **projection** step)
4. Validates the projected object against a zod schema (catches Whoop API drift)
5. Returns the structured JSON to the MCP client

Writes follow the same path plus a **preview gate**: every write tool defaults `confirm: false`, returning a preview of what would be sent. Claude must explicitly re-call with `confirm: true` to fire.

See [The 48 tools](#the-48-tools) for the full per-tool reference.

```

### Three layers per tool

Every tool is a schema + projection + handler:

- **`src/schemas/<tool>.ts`** — zod schema. The contract Claude sees. Used at runtime to validate the projection's output before returning.
- **`src/projections/<tool>.ts`** — pure function turning Whoop's raw BFF response into a flat object. All the "Whoop puts this data over there, not where you'd expect" knowledge lives here. Tested against captured fixtures.
- **`src/tools/v2/<tool>.ts`** — ~25-100 lines. Registers the tool, parses input args, calls the client, runs the projection, validates with zod, returns.

Almost no logic in the tool file. That's all in the projection — which makes the codebase highly testable (projections are pure transformations, tested against `tests/fixtures/*.json` without hitting the network).

### Shape drift handling

When Whoop changes a response shape, the projection emits unexpected data, zod's `.parse()` fails, and the MCP throws `WhoopProjectionError` instead of silently returning malformed data to Claude. Fix: use `whoop_raw` + `whoop_endpoints` to capture the new shape, update the projection, update the fixture, ship.

> **Recent example:** in May 2026, Whoop migrated recovery + strain deep-dives from `GRAPHING_CARD` tiles (keyed by `content.title` like `"RECOVERY"`) to `SCORE_GAUGE` + `CONTRIBUTORS_TILE` items with stable `content.id` keys (`RECOVERY_SCORE_GAUGE`, `CONTRIBUTORS_TILE_HRV`). Other deep-dives still use the old card-based shape. The escape-hatch tools made the migration trivial to debug.

## The 48 tools

Compact summary. **Full per-tool reference (input shape · source endpoints · output shape · notes) → [`TOOLS.md`](TOOLS.md).** Tools marked ⚠️ are writes (default `confirm: false`, preview-first). Tools marked 🔒 are gated — the catalog tool in the same group must be called once per session before they'll run.

| Group | Tools |
|---|---|
| **Snapshots & profile** (4) | `whoop_today` · `whoop_day` · `whoop_profile` · `whoop_calendar` |
| **Deep dives** (3) | `whoop_recovery` · `whoop_sleep` · `whoop_strain` |
| **Trends** (2) | `whoop_trend` · `whoop_compare` |
| **Stress + sleep coach** (2) | `whoop_stress` · `whoop_sleep_need` |
| **Live** (3) | `whoop_live_hr` · `whoop_live_state` · `whoop_live_stress` |
| **Activities** (5) | `whoop_workouts` · `whoop_workout` · `whoop_sports_catalog` · `whoop_activity_create` ⚠️🔒 · `whoop_activity_delete` ⚠️ |

**Total: 48** (31 reads + 14 writes + 2 escape hatches). For each tool's input args, source endpoint(s), and output shape, see [`TOOLS.md`](TOOLS.md).

---

## Authentication

Whoop's iOS app uses **AWS Cognito** routed through a Whoop-owned proxy (`/auth-service/v3/whoop/`). The proxy fills in `ClientId` + `SECRET_HASH` server-side — no IPA extraction needed.

**Bootstrap once** (email + password + SMS MFA code if your account has it on) → tokens written to `.env`. **After that, it's hands-off**: access tokens auto-refresh every 24h via the refresh token; refresh token lives ~30 days. Single-flight refresh gate prevents thundering-herd refreshes when concurrent tool calls all see a stale token at the same time.

**Error classes** (`src/whoop/errors.ts`):

| Error | When | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `WhoopAuthExpiredError` | 401 from Whoop | TokenManager refreshes on next call |
| `WhoopApiError` | 4xx with body | Description surfaced to caller |
| `WhoopServerError` | 5xx | Transient — retry |
| `WhoopProjectionError` | Projection output failed zod parse | Whoop changed shape — fix the projection |

When refresh-token lifetime expires (~30 days), re-run `npm run cognito-bootstrap` (local) or `npm run rebootstrap` (deployed). Brand-new SMS code, fresh 30-day window.

---

## Write-safety harness

Every write tool defaults `confirm: false`. The first call returns a **preview** of what would execute. Claude must explicitly re-call with `confirm: true` to fire the actual request. Without the gate, a hallucinated "log my workout" could create garbage activities on your account.

The preview shape (lives in `src/whoop/write_safety.ts`):

```json
{
  "preview": true,
  "will_execute": {
    "method": "POST",
    "path": "/weightlifting-service/v2/weightlifting-workout/activity",
    "body_summary": {
      "exercise_count": 3, "set_count": 12,
      "exercise_list": [{"name": "BENCHPRESS_BARBELL", "set_count": 5}, ...]
    }
  },
  "set_confirm_true_to_run": true
}
```

Claude reads this back to you, you confirm, Claude re-calls with `confirm: true`, the actual POST fires. Every write tool's output schema is a `withPreview(ReceiptSchema)` discriminated union — preview or receipt, never both.

---

## Bundled catalogs

Four datasets compiled into the MCP at build time (not fetched at runtime):

| Catalog | Entries | Catalog tool | Use |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `behaviors.ts` | 308 | `whoop_journal_catalog` | Journal behavior validation |
| `exercises.ts` | 372 | `whoop_lift_catalog` | Strength Trainer exercises |
| `sports.ts` | 203 | `whoop_sports_catalog` | `sport_id` ↔ name |
| `endpoints.ts` | 384 | `whoop_endpoints` | API path search |

**Session-scoped gate**: tools that take IDs from sports/exercises/behaviors refuse to run until the corresponding catalog tool has been called once per session. Keeps ~14k tokens out of the system prompt. AI calling e.g. `whoop_activity_create` first gets `{error: "Must call whoop_sports_catalog first…"}`.

---

## Configuration

### Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `WHOOP_EMAIL` | yes | Your Whoop login email |
| `WHOOP_PASSWORD` | yes (bootstrap only) | Your Whoop login password (used only during bootstrap) |
| `WHOOP_IOS_BEARER_TOKEN` | yes | Cognito access token (24h, auto-refreshed) |
| `WHOOP_COGNITO_REFRESH_TOKEN` | yes | Cognito refresh token (~30d) |
| `WHOOP_USER_ID` | no | Your Whoop user ID — used by `whoop_profile`, `whoop_leaderboard`. Avoids one bootstrap call per session. |
| `WHOOP_TIMEZONE` | no | IANA timezone (e.g., `America/Los_Angeles`). If unset, auto-detected from your Whoop profile and refreshed hourly. Set explicitly to override. |

### Claude Desktop config

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "whoop": {
      "command": "/opt/homebrew/bin/node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/whoop-mcp/dist/server.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

The MCP loads `.env` from the repo root (relative to `server.js`). Use absolute paths — Claude Desktop doesn't inherit shell `PATH`.

---

## Remote hosting

The MCP also speaks HTTP — deploy once, use from multiple devices. Same 48 tools, same auto-refresh, behind a bearer-token gate at a URL.

```bash
# 1. Local bootstrap (Cognito needs an interactive MFA prompt)
npm run cognito-bootstrap

# 2. Build + deploy via the shipped Dockerfile (Fly/Railway/Render/VPS — all work)
docker build -t whoop-mcp .

# 3. Run with env: WHOOP_EMAIL, WHOOP_IOS_BEARER_TOKEN, WHOOP_COGNITO_REFRESH_TOKEN,
#    MCP_TRANSPORT=http, MCP_AUTH_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
```

**Claude Desktop** doesn't natively speak remote MCP — bridge through stdio with [`mcp-remote`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-remote):

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "whoop": {
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://your-app.fly.dev/mcp",
           "--header", "Authorization:Bearer your-mcp-auth-token"]
}}}
```

**Claude Code** speaks remote MCP natively: `claude mcp add whoop --url ... --header ...`.

**claude.ai web + Claude mobile app** can't use a bearer token — their custom-connector UI only supports OAuth. The server includes an OAuth 2.1 + PKCE authorization server for exactly this. Enable it by setting two extra env vars:

```bash
AUTH_PASSWORD=<a password you'll type once when adding the connector>
PUBLIC_URL=https://your-app.fly.dev   # your server's public origin (the OAuth issuer)
```

Then in Claude: **Settings → Connectors → Add custom connector**, paste `https://your-app.fly.dev/mcp`, and Claude walks the OAuth flow. It pops a small password page (served by your server) — enter `AUTH_PASSWORD`, approve, done. The connector then syncs across every device logged into your Claude account (web, desktop, mobile). The password gate means a stranger who finds your URL still can't connect without it. `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` doubles as the JWT signing secret; leave `AUTH_PASSWORD` unset to disable this path.

All of the above is what `whoop-mcp cloud` automates for you — the manual steps here are for reference or hand-rolling.

**When Cognito expires (~30 days)**: `whoop-mcp refresh` from your Mac. Silent if your account has no SMS MFA; prompts for the code if it does. Pushes new tokens to your deployment, ~10s restart. Requires being at a machine with the repo + the platform CLI.

**Security**: bearer-token and OAuth paths both gate `/mcp`. Generate the token random (`openssl rand -hex 32`), HTTPS only, never commit, rotate if leaked. OAuth access/refresh tokens are stateless signed JWTs (survive restarts); auth codes are one-time + 60s-lived; PKCE S256 is enforced. `/health` is the only path without auth.

---

## The `whoop-mcp` CLI

Ships a CLI that wraps every npm script plus operational helpers. Works from any directory — it resolves its own install path, so `whoop-mcp deploy` from `~/Desktop` does the same thing as `cd whoop-mcp && fly deploy`.

```bash
# Install (after cloning + npm install + npm run build)
npm link        # symlinks `whoop-mcp` into your global PATH

whoop-mcp       # banner + full command list
```

Commands by group:

| Group | Commands |
|---|---|
| **Get started** | `cloud` ★ (guided server deploy + Claude connect) · `local` (guided local setup) |
| **Setup** | `auth` (first Whoop login) · `refresh [--app <name>]` (re-auth when the token expires) |
| **Deployed** | `deploy` · `logs` · `status` · `ping` |
| **Local dev** | `start [--http]` · `dev` · `dev:http` · `build` · `test` · `typecheck` |
| **Inspect** | `info` · `tools` · `config <stdio\|http>` |
| **Help** | `help` · `version` (+ `--help`, `-v` aliases) |

Most people only ever need the two **Get started** commands plus `refresh`. The rest are for power users — `whoop-mcp ping` ("is my deploy alive"), `whoop-mcp logs`, `whoop-mcp start` (drop-in for `node dist/server.js`), etc.

---

## Privacy + security

- **Credentials live in `.env` on your machine.** Email, password, access token, refresh token — never leave your filesystem. Claude can't read them (it doesn't have filesystem access unless you wire in a filesystem MCP).
- **The only outbound traffic is HTTPS to `api.prod.whoop.com`.** No telemetry, no analytics, no third-party servers. The MCP is open source — every line that touches your data is auditable.
- **Write safety**: every write tool defaults to `confirm: false`. The preview shape includes what would be sent. You see it in chat before any mutation. To go further, remove specific writes from `src/tools/register.ts` or use Claude Desktop's "always require approval" setting.

---

## Troubleshooting

**"AUTH FAIL: Cognito InitiateAuth failed (400)"**
> Wrong email or password. Double-check `.env`.

**"AUTH FAIL: Cognito MFA challenge missing Session token"**
> The InitiateAuth response was malformed (unusual). Re-run `npm run cognito-bootstrap` — Cognito occasionally drops sessions.

**"MFA verification did not return tokens"**
> You entered the wrong SMS code (or it timed out). Codes expire after ~3 minutes.

**"WhoopAuthExpiredError" after every call**
> Your refresh token has expired (>30 days since last bootstrap). For a **local install**, re-run `npm run cognito-bootstrap`. For a **deployed install** (Fly etc.), run `npm run rebootstrap` from your Mac — it re-bootstraps locally AND pushes the new tokens to your deployed app's secrets in one step. Either way you'll get a fresh SMS code on your phone that you type in the terminal.

**"WhoopServerError: 502" / "503" / "504"**
> Whoop's servers are having issues. Retry in 30 seconds.

**Claude says it doesn't see any whoop tools**
> Check `claude_desktop_config.json` paths are absolute. Restart Claude Desktop fully (quit, then reopen).
> Check the MCP server runs without errors: `npm run dev` — it should start silently and wait on stdin.

**"WhoopApiError: 422 on /profile-service/v1/profile"**
> Your `whoop_profile_update` body is too partial. Send most fields (gender from {MALE,FEMALE,NON_BINARY} only, birthday as YYYY-MM-DD or ISO datetime, country ISO-2). If `country=US`, also send `state` — Whoop returns 400 `"AdminDivision (state) must be set for US"` otherwise.

**"Whoop API error 409 on /weightlifting-service/v2/weightlifting-workout/activity"**
> Time window conflicts with an existing workout. Use a different range.

**"WhoopProjectionError for whoop_X"**
> Whoop changed a response shape. Capture the new response (e.g. via `whoop_raw`), inspect, update the projection.

**Tests fail after `git pull`**
> Pull may have updated captured fixtures. Run `npm test` again to see what changed. If projections need updating, that's the work.

**`npm run build` fails with "Top-level await is currently not supported with the 'cjs' output format"**
> You're using an old Node. Upgrade to Node 24+.

**"Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '.env'"**
> Create `.env` at the repo root (or wherever `dist/server.js` is being run from — the MCP loads `.env` relative to the entry).

**"Cannot find module '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js'"**
> Run `npm install`.

**"AbortError: This operation was aborted"**
> A request to Whoop's API took longer than 30s. Either Whoop is slow or your network is slow. Retry.

## Comparison to alternatives

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|
| **This MCP** | Full iOS API surface (48 total: 32 reads + 14 writes + 2 escape hatches), writes supported, structured outputs, auto-refresh, write-safety, session-scoped catalog gate | Unsupported by Whoop (see [FAQ](#faq) for what that means); reverse-engineered (Whoop could break it at any time); local install required |
| Whoop's public OAuth API | Official, supported, 6 webhook events, scoped permissions | Only 13 endpoints; read-only; no journal/strength/stress/coach/smart-alarm/trends/hypnogram; numeric `sport_id` removed 2025-09-01; 429s exist |
| HealthKit-based scraper | Bypass Whoop entirely; uses Apple's data sync | Loses Whoop-specific data (recovery score, journal, coach); requires iOS device involvement |
| Direct mitmproxy capture | See everything | Manual, not programmable, doesn't scale |
| Whoop iOS app + screenshots → Claude | Works without code | Painful, slow, no writes |

This MCP is the only option for **programmatic write access** to your Whoop data right now.

## FAQ

**Q: Is this supported by Whoop?**
A: No. This MCP works through Whoop's private iOS API, which isn't a public surface they intend for third-party tools. Whoop's terms reserve the right to take action against accounts they catch using unsupported integrations — realistically that means suspending API access or terminating the membership. The author has used the MCP heavily for weeks without issue, and traffic patterns look similar to normal app usage, but there's no guarantee. If losing your Whoop account would be a problem for you, don't use this.

**Q: Why not use Whoop's public OAuth API instead?**
A: It's 13 endpoints, all read-only, no journal, no strength, no stress, no coach, no smart alarm, no trends beyond a single recovery score per day. Whoop also pulled numeric `sport_id` past 2025-09-01 (now `sport_name` strings only). If you only need recovery score + sleep stage totals + workout list, the OAuth API is the right answer.

**Q: Will this work with the Whoop 4.0 vs 5.0 strap?**
A: Yes — the API doesn't care which strap you have. It cares about your account.

**Q: What about Whoop 6.0?**
A: When it launches and the iOS app updates, the api version may bump from 7 to 8. The MCP's `constants.ts` may need an update. Worst case, projections break and you fix them.

**Q: Can I run this on a server / cloud / always-on?**
A: Sure. The MCP doesn't care where it runs. Just make sure your `.env` survives restarts.

**Q: Can I share this MCP with my friends?**
A: Each user needs their own `.env` with their own Whoop credentials. Don't share tokens.

**Q: Is there an HTTP transport instead of stdio?**
A: Not yet. The MCP SDK supports SSE but we haven't wired it. PR welcome.

**Q: Does this support Claude's Computer Use API?**
A: It's MCP-compatible — anything that speaks MCP can talk to it.

**Q: Why TypeScript instead of Python?**
A: The MCP SDK is most mature in TypeScript. Also Whoop's API responses are heavily nested — zod is genuinely the best validation library for that shape work.

**Q: Why Node 24 specifically?**
A: Uses `import.meta.dirname` (added in 20.11), modern `fetch`, native ESM, `AbortController`. Node 18 might work; 16 won't.

**Q: How long did this take?**
A: ~3 weeks of evening/weekend work for v1, plus another week to rewrite as v2 with proper projections and the write-safety harness.

**Q: Will you maintain this?**
A: Best-effort. PRs welcome.
